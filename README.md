A private place to store my ideas, resources, as well as to share and discuss content. 

Hello any and all!

Mia here. I am a soon-to-be software engineering student at MIT starting late February. 
As of today, 1/19/2021, I have little to no coding experience and I can't wait to watch my GitHub Repositories grow as I learn.
